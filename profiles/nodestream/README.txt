NODESTREAM
----------

Nodestream is a Drupal installation profile designed to provide a platform for
building and extending highly functional websites quickly. Based on best practices,
Nodestream provides a set of well maintained, generic and widely used modules
that provide a solid foundation for your website.

NodeStream Core is the base platform and NodeStream products are great add on
features that can be turned on or off to target your project for things like
Intranets, Newspapers, or enterprise websites.

NodeStream can be used as a simple starting point, or leveraged to provide
complex functionality out of the box.

For more information about features, see http://nodestream.org/. For
