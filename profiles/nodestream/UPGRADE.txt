NodeStream 7 alpha instructions

Currently there is no easy upgrade path between alpha versions. The currently
recommended way of upgrading NodeStream is to remove the NodeStream folder, run
clone down the repository again and run the make file. This is to make sure that
files in any of the contributed modules are properly removed if any files have
been removed.

Modules will not be removed without an upgrade path and/or a very clear 
advertisement that this is happening. No modules will be removed once NodeStream
hits beta.
